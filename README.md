## What is the Korean SAT?

**Su-neung**(**수능**, abbreviation of 대학**수**학**능**력시험) is the college entrance exam of South Korea, officially recognized as **CSAT**(College Scholastic Ability Test) in English.

Suneung lasts 8-9 hours, consisting of the following subjects.
 - Language Arts (80 min.)
 - Mathematics (100 min.)
 - English (70 min.)
 - Korean History (30 min.)
 - Social Studies / Science (2 elective subjects, 30 min. each)
 - Foreign Language / Classical Chinese (optional, 40 min.)

The institute in charge, [KICE](https://www.kice.re.kr/sub/info.do?m=0205&s=english),
introduces the exam as a *'reliable data for college admissions,'*
as well as a benchmark that *'impacts teaching and learning practices in high schools.'*

This is a personal passion project. I cannot guarantee that all exams will be translated.

Currently translated: `1994 ~ 2000`, `2005`, `2011`, `2014 ~ 2024`

## Why am I making it?

Word about Suneung has spread well beyond the border of the country,
whether it be the difficulty or its effect on the lives of students.

Compared to its infamy, **I've rarely seen Suneung exams presented in English** for the international population to examine.
So I'm making one myself.

**Why is it specifically the math exams?**
Well, the Language Arts exams are simply impossible to translate
*(how would I translate Korean poems while maintaining rhyme structures?)*
and the English exams are, well, in English.
Science exams are translatable but requires a lot of work, since they always contain loads of diagrams with Korean text.

Suneung math is quite an assortment of carefully crafted problems.
It would generally be a helpful resource if you study or teach math.
Try it if you're a math nerd like me!

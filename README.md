## What is Suneung?

**Su-neung**(**수능**, abbreviation of 대학**수**학**능**력시험) is a college entrance exam in South Korea.
It is officially recognized as **CSAT**(College Scholastic Ability Test) in English.

Suneung is a test lasting 8-9 hours, consisting of the following subjects.
 - Language Arts (80 minutes)
 - Mathematics (100 minutes)
 - English (70 minutes)
 - Korean History (30 minutes)
 - Social Studies / Science (2 elective subjects, 30 minutes each)
 - Foreign Language / Classical Chinese (optional, 40 minutes)

[KICE](https://www.kice.re.kr/sub/info.do?m=0205&s=english), the institute in charge of CSAT,
introduces it as a 'reliable data for college admissions,'
as well as a benchmark that 'impacts teaching and learning practices in high schools.'

An English translation of Suneung, mainly the mathematics exams.

This is currently a personal passion project, and I am unsure how many exams will be translated.

Translated exams: `1994 ~ 2000`, `2005`, `2011`, `2014 ~ 2024`

## Why am I making it?

The infamy of Suneung has well spread beyond the boundaries of the country,
whether it be its difficulty or its affect on students' lives.

I have seen some English Youtubers try a few hard English and Math questions from Suneung,
but never the exam as a whole, maybe due to not having any good translated resources.

CSAT math is quite an assortment of carefully crafted problems, difficult or not.
It would be a helpful resource if you study or teach math.

If you're a math nerd try it! The time limit is 100 minutes.

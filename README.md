## What is Suneung?

**Su-neung**(**수능**, abbreviation of 대학**수**학**능**력시험) is a college entrance exam in South Korea.
It is officially recognized as **CSAT**(College Scholastic Ability Test) in English.

Suneung is a test lasting 8-9 hours, consisting of the following subjects.
 - Language Arts (80 minutes)
 - Mathematics (100 minutes)
 - English (70 minutes)
 - Korean History (30 minutes)
 - Social Studies / Science (2 elective subjects, 30 minutes each)
 - Foreign Language / Classical Chinese (optional, 40 minutes)

[KICE](https://www.kice.re.kr/sub/info.do?m=0205&s=english), the institute in charge of CSAT,
introduces it as a 'reliable data for college admissions,'
as well as a benchmark that 'impacts teaching and learning practices in high schools.'

This is currently a personal passion project, and I am unsure how many exams will be translated.

Translated exams: `1994`, `1997`, `1999`, `2005`, `2011`, `2015`, `2017 ~ 2024`

## Why am I making it?

The infamy of Suneung has well spread beyond the boundaries of the country,
whether it be its difficulty or its affect on students' lives.

I have seen English-speaking Youtubers try some hard English and Math questions from Suneung,
but I couldn't find any good resource of a Suneung math exam translated as a whole.

I thought if someone who doesn't speak Korean wants to know how the CSAT is structured, what it tries to evaluate, etc.,
being able to examine the full test would be quite helpful.

Also, CSAT math is quite an assortment of carefully crafted problems, difficult or not.
It would generally be a helpful resource if you study or teach math.

If you're a math nerd try it! The time limit is 100 minutes.

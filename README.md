## What is CSAT?

**CSAT**(College Scholastic Ability Test) is a college entrance exam in South Korea.
It is often called **Su-neung**(수능), an abbreviation of its Korean name(대학수학능력시험).

It is a test lasting 8-9 hours, consisting of subjects such as:
 - Language Arts
 - Mathematics
 - English
 - Korean History
 - Social Studies / Science

[KICE](https://www.kice.re.kr/sub/info.do?m=0205&s=english), the institute in charge of CSAT,
introduces it as a 'reliable data for college admissions,'
as well as a benchmark that 'impacts teaching and learning practices in high schools.'

## What is this project?

An English translation of CSAT exams, mainly the mathematics exams.

This is currently a personal passion project, and I am unsure how many exams will be translated.

Translated exams: `2019`, `2024`

## Why am I making it?

The infamy of CSAT has well spread beyond the boundaries of the country,
whether it be its difficulty or its affect on students' lives.

I have seen English-speaking Youtubers try some hard English and Math questions from CSAT,
but I couldn't find any good resource of a CSAT math exam translated as a whole.

I thought if someone who doesn't speak Korean wants to know how the CSAT is structured, what it tries to evaluate, etc.,
being able to examine the full test would be quite helpful.

Also, CSAT math is quite an assortment of carefully crafted problems, difficult or not.
It would generally be a helpful resource if you study or teach math.

If you're a math nerd try it! The time limit is 100 minutes.
